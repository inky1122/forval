<h3 class="h3">A Brief History of Bitcoin Era</h3>
<div class="p-big">Bitcoin was the first digital currency to be introduced to the world and this happened over a decade ago. While Bitcoin was the first to go live, there were previous attempts to launch digital currencies in the past. <br />
<br />
Satoshi Nakamoto, the person or group behind Bitcoin (identity still unknown to date), mined the first Bitcoin block, called the Genesis Block in January 2009. The next major event was in 2010 when Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas using BTC. That was the first time BTC was used to pay for actual goods in the real world. <br />
<br />
It was also in 2010 that cryptocurrency exchanges started to emerge. By 2013, we had over ten different cryptocurrencies available around the world. Over the past few years, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created and the market has been growing ever since. <br />
<br />
As the cryptocurrency world keeps expanding and gaining popularity, an increasing number of stores, brands, and networks around the globe are accepting them as a means of payment. <br />
<br />
With the growing popularity and use of these digital currencies, the value of cryptocurrencies has been increasing, and so too have the trading profits. These features have led to two significant developments in the crypto space:</div>
<ul role="list" class="space-list">
<li class="space-li">An increasing number of people are now holding cryptocurrencies, saving, trading, and profiting from them. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has held on to its position as the number one in the industry</li>
<li class="space-li">Digital asset trading software, like Bitcoin Era, have been making it easy for people with zero trading experience to buy, sell, and profit from digital currency trading.</li>
</ul>
<div class="p-big">This means that now, you too can make money from trading a wide range of cryptocurrencies.</div>
</div>
<div class="container center w-container">
<a href="#formTop" class="yellow-btn systeml-btn anchor-js">BEGIN TRADING TODAY</a>
<h3 class="h3">What is the Bitcoin Era System?</h3>
<div class="p-big">Bitcoin Era is a trading system that allows people to trade cryptocurrencies manually or automatically. The manual and automated features available on the software make it easy for anyone to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies profitably. As a result of this, it is not relevant if you have trading experience or not, as you will still be able to succeed. <br />
<br />
This means that now, you too can make money from trading a wide range of cryptocurrencies.The pre-set trading rules, inserted by the trader, are followed by Bitcoin Era and trades are therefore always made to match your trading preferences and risk level. With only a few minutes of work needed a day, it is easy to use the software and to earn consistent profits with it. At any time, the user can change the settings to suit the market conditions, their experience level, or risk-taking levels.</div>
